**Caesar Cipher**

I attempted both examples and was unable to create a process whereby I could accomplish the puzzle. In regards to the caesar cipher, I would imagine that you could make an array consisting of each letter of the alphabet. By using the shift() command, you could remove the number of letters that the user specified with a specific number. Unfortunately this was over my head in being able to explain or create an example of how this would be done. At this current stage of my javascript understanding I'm left unsure of how to make this into a reality.
